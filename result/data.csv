It was definitely feeling like fall this week in Vancouver, and sadly I am already starting to get depressed by the rain! We don't really have any plans this weekend - Tony is playing board games today and I am working on the blog. Later I plan on doing laundry and maybe going to yoga, and then tonight and tomorrow we don't have anything! We should (I hate saying should) probably get groceries at some point this weekend too, so we'll see what happens. This is the new Banana Republic Factory top that I told you about last week - isn't it cute?! I'm sad it's not online. It's similar to the Old Navy top from last week, but what I like about this one more is that the fabric is more of a polyester crepe, so it doesn't wrinkle as easily, and the elastic on the arms is looser, so you don't feel like you have to pull down on them as much. Button Front Top by Banana Republic Factory (similar) Mid-Rise Pixie Ankle Pants by Old Navy Zoe Suede D'Orsay Flats by J.Crew Factory Faux Pearl Earrings by ? (old, similar) I feel like I am always wearing some variation of this outfit! Everything here is old but you can find similar options everywhere - it's just a longer cardigan/open front sweater + a floral wrap dress + flats! I wore mules here because I feel like they are a bit more summery but you can wear whatever shoes you want with this type of outfit! I would just say match them to either the cardigan or dress for a cohesive look. Long Cardigan by Old Navy (similar) Floral Wrap Dress by Dynamite (old, similar) Leather Mules by Town Shoes (old, similar) Hair Clip by Urban Outfitters Necklace by GemPassionJewelry (Etsy) I wasn't sure if I was accessorizing too much here - velvet hair bow, earrings and a tassel necklace? What do you think? One thing that I thought was good about this outfit is the combination of summer and fall. Plaid pants = fall. Sleeveless tunic = summer. Heavy knit material of tunic = fall. Mules = summer. Sleeveless Knit Tunic by J.Crew (old, similar) Mid-Rise Pixie Ankle Pants by Old Navy Trace Mules by Steve Madden (old, similar) Tassel Necklace by J.Crew Factory (old, similar) Earrings by Urban Outfitters This Zara dress is an oldie but a goodie! Wearing it actually got me thinking that I should check out Zara for fall dresses & skirts. It's not somewhere I shop that much actually, I find their website to be overwhelming (so.much.stuff) and the product photos are terrible, it's hard to see what the actual clothing looks like because the models are all in weird poses. They don't often list the measurements of their garments either, so it's basically a guessing game how something will fit. Having said that, I did find a few things that I'm willing to try and am sharing below! Polka Dot Dress by Zara (old, similar, similar) Edie Leather Loafers by J.Crew Factory Infinity Necklace by Tiffany & Co. (gift) Something is going on with ShopStyle right now that is making it really hard to link to Old Navy products, so I'm sorry that the widgets (product images) are still saying Sold Out! They're not sold out! As I mentioned above, this week I did some online browsing at Zara for fall skirts and dresses. Here's what's currently in my cart: Textured Weave Dress Floral Print Dress Openwork Knit Skirt Ribbed Midi Skirt Print Dress Printed Shirt Dress Printed Midi Dress Obviously I am not going to order everything in my cart, especially after I decided to check out if H&M had anything similar, which they definitely do! Here's what's in my H&M cart: Dress with Tie Belt Smocked Chiffon Dress Cap-sleeved Dress Ribbed Dress Crêped Dress Rib-Knit Skirt Jacquard-weave Skirt Plaid Skirt Short Skirt I will update you next week with what I decided to go with! After seeing the photos of myself with straight hair this week I decided it was time to book an appointment for a cut and colour! It's just looking a little too grown out and too blonde at the ends for what feels like now officially fall. I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do yet, probably nothing drastic but hopefully something that will feel fresh and seasonally appropriate :) . Also, my hair has been super frizzy lately and just not responding to dry shampoo and second & third day styling like it used to, which has been super frustrating! Last time I got my hair cut (in July) I was complaining to my stylist about this and she thought it might have just been the humidity, but now that it's still happening I hope she has some miracle product (that doesn't feel like product) that can help me! I've tried this Living Proof stuff and it doesn't seem to do anything for me. Have you guys tried it? Or some other de-frizzing product that you swear by? Please share!! Last weekend I transitioned my closet from summer to fall/winter which was sad, but also necessary. It felt really good to put away all my sandals actually, I have so much more space now! LOL . And I have SO many summer dresses that I put away - more than I show on here even! The Bon Iver concert last weekend was great, too! He obviously played more of his new stuff, which I'm not as into as his old stuff, but it was still a great show and it was fun to be in the third row. Usually we're somewhere up in the stands basically watching the screens, so it was nice to be able to actually watch the musicians themselves! Also, I didn't know this but the girl from Wye Oak is in Bon Iver now! I just made these cookies by Brittany at Eating Bird Food and ate two of them immediately. I also can't resist eating some of the dough 🤷. For lunches this week I think I'm going to make a variation of this Slow Cooker Curry with Quinoa. I have two frozen chicken breasts so I'm going to use those instead of chickpeas, and I'm worried about the broccoli going mushy so I'm going to substitute frozen peas. I also found a bag of frozen cauliflower florets at the store, so I might add those as well. That'll be a tomorrow project! Anyways, I think I've rambled on enough. If you've stayed till the end, THANK YOU! LOL xo JULES"

I'm okay! The weather was summer-like this week, hot & sunny so that is a win, but I've also been battling with incessant chin (& this week body!) acne, plus I got my period! (I'm sure they're related!) But I worked out 3 times this week, which for a short week is pretty good, and I have some banana bread in the oven right now which is making the house smell amazing and I can't wait to have some! This dress again! I really went hard on wearing this dress at the beginning of Spring so I eased up a bit over the Summer and now it's back! Also I don't know what it is about this dress but I really don't mind that it's a little bit longer than my usual short dresses. It's something I should keep in mind for future purchases for sure. This dress is sold out in this colour, but is still available in a pretty purple floral pattern. If you're looking for a yellow dress, this one looks really pretty! Dress by Old Navy (this colour sold out, similar) Scalloped Sandals by J.Crew Factory Gold Hoop Earrings by Joe Fresh (similar) Necklace by GemPassionJewelry (Etsy) *the widget (image) says sold out but it's not!* One of my new purchases from this post! This top appears to be sold out in this pattern in Canada, but available in the US. I love the mustard colour it comes in as well! This top wrinkles pretty easily just to warn you. I'm wearing the XS here and it fits great and TTS. Polka Dot Button Front Top by Old Navy Mid-Rise Pixie Ankle Pants by Old Navy Edie Leather Loafers by J.Crew Factory Infinity Necklace by Tiffany & Co. (gift) *the widget (image) says sold out but they're not!* I decided to give this midi skirt another try and really like it this way, with a simple tank top and the sleeveless vest over top. Modern Tank by Gap Floral Midi Skirt by Gap (this colour sold out, similar) Dunkirk/Olivie Sweater by Wilfred (Aritzia via Poshmark) Scalloped Sandals by J.Crew Factory Necklace by GemPassionJewelry (Etsy) Earrings by Urban Outfitters *the widget (image) says sold out but it's not!* Another new top from this post! This top is actually navy and white, but it looks like black. Either way, it's made of a soft cotton and fits TTS (I'm wearing an XS). Sleeveless Printed Top by Old Navy Mid-Rise Pixie Ankle Pants by Old Navy (old colour) Edie Leather Loafers by J.Crew Factory Tortoise Hoop Earrings by J.Crew Factory *the widget (image) says sold out but they're not!* Tonight we are going to see Bon Iver and have really good seats so I'm excited about that, and this mirror from Amazon arrived this week so we're going to try it in the dining room. I hope it works so we don't have to go try and find another one! We still have tons of basil in our garden so Tony dried some this week and I think I'm going to try and make a pesto this weekend! What should we do with it? I'm thinking pasta or pizza ... We only have a mini food processor or a not very good blender so fingers crossed it works! What else? I've been listening to the new Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey albums this week on repeat and am loving both! TV has been a little dry, we finished Mindhunter season 2 last weekend (overall I was disappointed), and are watching Australian Survivor and Amazing Race Canada but that's kind of it! We need a good drama series to get into. I sold my first item through Poshmark and it was so easy! Yes, it's more expensive than eBay but I love that they take care of shipping and I know as a buyer it's so much easier as well. We went to the outlets last weekend (it was SO busy - we literally spent 30 minutes driving around the parking lot trying to get a spot) and I bought a few things from Gap Factory and Banana Republic Factory: V-Neck Pullover Sweater (in blue heather) Graphic Crewneck Pullover Sweater (in oatmeal stripe) Floral Jacquard Blouse (in black and white) Plaid Knit Wrap Sheath Dress Plus a cute short sleeve red blouse with white flowers that I can't find online. We also went to Urban Outfitters last weekend and I bought some new earrings, sunglasses and hair clips! I think that's it for now - I hope you're having a great weekend and thank you so much for visiting! xo JULES"

Happy new week. I hope you had a great weekend. It doesn't even feel like fall anymore here in Maryland, seems like winter just pushed fall right out of the way. It has been freezing the last couple of days and I believe it may snow towards the end of the week and into next week. Although, I don't like shoveling snow, I wouldn't mind being snowed in and snuggled up. Today's look can be worn as a holiday work style inspiration but its equally as perfect even after the holiday season. I love the bow and floral details of this top; I paired it with matching green pants and completed my look with beige pumps which brings out the nude tone in the blouse Thank you for stopping by. Have a lovely week! XOXO PRISCILLA"

The romper is worked from the top down, beginning with raglan shaping in back-and-forth rows with turning. The pattern is written with standard English knitting terms and provides a detailed description to complete the romper in the photo, including charts for the stitch pattern, and diagrams for stitch distribution for the different sizes. The stitch pattern itself is not written out - in order to make this garment as pictured, you need to be able to read charts! If you prefer, you can skip the stitch pattern altogether and work the garment in plain stockinette - this option does not require chart-reading skills, and instructions for this modification are contained in the pattern. This pattern can also be used to make a tunic or dress by lengthening the body of the garment. Needed skills: Knit and purl stitches, increases and decreases, provisional crochet cast-on using a crochet hook and waste yarn, Kitchener grafting, working from charts, three-needle bind-off, basic sewing skills (reinforcing buttonholes, sewing on buttons). This is NOT a recipe like my other patterns, you will have to obtain gauge and follow my instructions.

Please check with your country’s customs office to determine these costs. Please note, standard shipping on all the UK and most of the EU orders due to current situation in the world and quarantines take much longer than usually. We see extended delivery times for most orders to the UK and some EU countries, and national posts can no longer guarantee any delivery timings. Please, place your order if you allow delays for the delivery. Our apologies for any inconvenience. At the same time, most of the US orders arrive within 2 weeks upon dispatch, but we can't guarantee any timings here as well unfortunately.

Because of quarantines national posts (standard shipping) work with big delays now unfortunately. Understanding that you may want to receive your order as soon as possible and wishing to show our support, we decided to send all orders with expedited shipping method via the shipping partner in the USA during this time for free. HOW IT WORKS We carefully make and pack all orders in our studio in Kyiv, Ukraine. Then we gather all packed orders into one consolidated shipment and send it to our shipping partner's office (located in Pennsylvania, USA) via DHL, who delivers shipments there within 2-4 working days and almost without delays. As soon as the office receives the consolidated packages, they divide this consolidated shipment and immediately send them to the USPS. Delivery in the USA takes from 1 to 3 days usually, thereby ensuring quick delivery to you. Delivery to Canada, Australia, Mexico and some other countries is also carried out through the office in the USA and takes normally about 7-10 business days. So even though you will see the stamp which says that your package arrived from Pennsylvania, don’t doubt we personally packed your order and sent it from Kyiv. And if for some reason you would like to exchange or return your order, you need to send it to Kyiv, Ukraine, not back to Pennsylvania. Take care and be safe! We believe that things will return to normal soon!"
